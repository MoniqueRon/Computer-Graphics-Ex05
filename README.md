# Exercise 5 â€“ Modeling with WebGL

The bonus part of the code adds textured banners to the goal object in the 3D scene. The banners are created by drawing custom text on canvases, which are then used as textures for plane meshes. These meshes, along with supporting poles, are grouped together and added to the scene, enhancing the visual representation of the goal. 
The banners can be customized by adjusting the text, font, colors, and positioning.
